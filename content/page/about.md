Salim is a weird creature, he thinks everyone is lazy `like him`.
The thing is, no one told him the truth, so he's condamned to live in the misundertanding of the society.

I like:

- Reading/Watching japanease shit
- Chilling in my bed
- Listening to pretty much all kinds of music, how exotic they can be.

What else do you need?

### My history

To be honest, i've always been interested in the IT field. I've tought about doing some web development before finding interest in linux administration, tooling, monitoring, and other stuff.
